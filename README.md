# Face Recognition Attendance System (FRAS)

üìå Description

This study investigates the creation and application of a Face Recognition Attendance System (FRAS) to address the growing need for secure and efficient attendance monitoring. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the system eliminates traditional methods like card swipes and manual sign-ins, instead providing automated, reliable face-based identity verification. The core component of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on diverse facial image datasets, enabling robust performance across various lighting, angles, and expressions.

Key features include real-time face detection and recognition, seamless enrollment and authentication, and strong security measures to protect sensitive biometric data.
